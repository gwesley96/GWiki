HTT.1.1.2.4. An (∞, 1)-category (AKA ∞-category) is a simplicial set $\mathcal{C}$ in which all inner horns have fillers.
Every (ordinary) category $\mathcal{C}$ can be viewed as an (∞, 1)-category by taking the nerve $N\mathcal{C}$.

\begin{remark}
Many definitions and statements of results from ordinary category theory generalize straightforwardly to (∞, 1)-categories, often simply by replacing bijections of Hom-sets with weak homotopy equivalences of mapping spaces, but with current technology the traditional proofs do not generalize, and instead often require delicate model specific arguments: most of this work has been done using the model of quasicategories.
